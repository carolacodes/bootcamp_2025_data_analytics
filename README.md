### Project Requirements

1. Install `Docker` [and (optional) `lazydocker`]
1. Install `uv`
1. Run `uv venv`

---

1. To run the project: `uv run main.py`
1. To run `Jupyter`:
   _(This is more convenient than `google colab` for connecting to the local database)_
   - `uv run jupyter JupyterNB.ipynb` (The notebook only)
   - `uv run jupyter lab JupyterNB.ipynb` (the full platform)
